<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Brian Madison, and I'm an aspiring code developer in my early 30's. I picked up coding to get myself out of having to work in shitty warehouses or shops sweating my balls off dawn till dusk. And so far? I'm loving everything I've learned so far! I can't wait to take the skills I pick up from this course and apply them to real world instances. I thnank my loving girlfriend every day for pushing me to just be a better man. I thank our kids for being kind and loving boys that support my growth.</p>

<p>I'm a GIGANTIC nerd. I love Star Wars, anime, video games, Dungeons and Dragons, you name it. Something about the character- and world-building just strikes a chrod in me. I love the rush of dopamine I feel as I watch new things that pique my interests. I've been watching anime probably since I was like 8. It started with Dragon Ball Z and Gundam, and now I'm still watching One Piece 20 years later!</p>
